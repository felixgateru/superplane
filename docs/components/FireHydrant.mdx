## On New Incident

The On New Incident trigger starts a workflow execution when a new incident is created in FireHydrant.

### Use Cases

- **Incident response**: Automatically notify Slack, update a status page, or create a Jira ticket when an incident is opened
- **Alert escalation**: Trigger escalation workflows when critical incidents are created
- **Cross-tool sync**: Sync new FireHydrant incidents to other incident management tools

### Configuration

- **Event Types** (required): Choose which event types to subscribe to — Incidents, Private Incidents, or both. At least one must be selected.
- **Severities** (optional): Filter by severity levels. Only incidents matching the selected severities will trigger the workflow. If empty, all new incidents will trigger.

### Event Data

Each incident event includes:
- **name**: Incident name/title
- **number**: Incident number
- **severity**: Severity level
- **priority**: Priority level
- **current_milestone**: Current milestone (e.g., started, acknowledged)
- **created_at**: Creation timestamp
- **summary**: Incident summary

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a FireHydrant webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Note

FireHydrant webhooks deliver all incident events. This trigger filters for only `CREATED` operations, ensuring only new incidents fire the workflow.

- **Cross-tool sync**: Open a FireHydrant incident from other SuperPlane triggers (e.g., PagerDuty, Rootly, GitHub)
- **Manual incident creation**: Create incidents from workflow events
- **Automated response**: Automatically declare incidents when thresholds are breached

### Configuration

- **Name**: Incident name/title (required, supports expressions)
- **Summary**: Short summary of the incident (optional, supports expressions)
- **Description**: Detailed description of the incident (optional, supports expressions)
- **Severity**: Severity level, e.g., SEV1, SEV2 (optional, populated from FireHydrant)
- **Priority**: Priority level, e.g., P1, P2 (optional, populated from FireHydrant)

### Output

Returns the created incident object including:
- **id**: Incident ID
- **name**: Incident name
- **description**: Incident description
- **summary**: Incident summary
- **customer_impact_summary**: Summary of customer impact
- **current_milestone**: Current milestone (e.g., started, acknowledged)
- **number**: Incident number
- **severity**: Severity level
- **priority**: Priority level
- **created_at**: Creation timestamp
- **started_at**: Start timestamp
- **tag_list**: List of tags associated with the incident
- **impacts**: List of impacts associated with the incident
- **milestones**: List of milestones associated with the incident
