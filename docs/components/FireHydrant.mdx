## Triggers

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="On Incident" href="#on-incident" description="Runs when an incident is created or reaches a specific milestone in FireHydrant" />

## Instructions

To connect FireHydrant, create an API key:

1. Go to **Settings → API Keys → Create API Key** in your FireHydrant account. This requires Owner permissions.
2. The API key should have **Write Access** in order to create incidents and webhooks.
3. Copy the API key and paste it into the configuration for this integration.

## On Incident

The On Incident trigger starts a workflow execution when a FireHydrant incident is created or reaches a specific milestone.

### Use Cases

- **Incident response**: Automatically notify Slack, update a status page, or create a Jira ticket when an incident is opened
- **Alert escalation**: Trigger escalation workflows when critical incidents are created
- **Milestone tracking**: React to incidents reaching specific milestones such as mitigated or resolved
- **Cross-tool sync**: Sync new FireHydrant incidents to other incident management tools

### Configuration

- **Current Milestone**: Select which incident milestones to trigger on (started, acknowledged, mitigated, resolved, etc.). The workflow will trigger when an incident is created or updated to match any of the selected milestones.
- **Severities** (optional): Filter by severity levels. Only incidents matching the selected severities will trigger the workflow. If empty, all severities are accepted.

### Event Data

Each incident event includes:
- **name**: Incident name/title
- **number**: Incident number
- **severity**: Severity level
- **priority**: Priority level
- **current_milestone**: Current milestone (e.g., started, acknowledged)
- **summary**: Incident summary

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a FireHydrant webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.
